# Lab-isolation
Built a safe, fully isolated hacking lab where attacks, malware, and exploits cannot escape to the real internet.🚀 Completed My Isolated Cybersecurity Home Lab Setup!



I recently built a fully isolated penetration-testing lab to safely practice ethical hacking, network analysis, and security testing. This environment ensures all activities remain contained with no internet exposure, following proper security and safety standards.



What I built:

✅Configured a Host-Only VirtualBox network for complete isolation

✅Installed and set up Windows (target machine) and Kali Linux (attacker machine)

✅Assigned static IPs to create a stable, controlled environment

Verified communication between machines using ping tests

✅Confirmed zero internet connectivity to prevent malware or exploits from escaping the lab

Ensured a clean, secure setup suitable for penetration-testing practice



 What I learned:

➡️Network isolation & host-only virtualization

➡️Static IP configuration and network planning

➡️Safe ethical hacking lab design

➡️Virtual machine management (Windows & Kali)

➡️Practical cybersecurity fundamentals



This project helped me strengthen my understanding of virtualized environments and gave me a safe platform to continue learning penetration testing and offensive security tools.



Excited to build more advanced setups next—like vulnerable machines, and attack simulations!
